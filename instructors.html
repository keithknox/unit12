While competing in Judo, he also became a member of the Howard Wrestling Team where he met fellow instructor Isaac July. Upon graduating, Ervin spent 3 years in Japan training Judo and teaching it to both elementary and junior high kids in the village of Murone-mura. He received his Black Belt from the Kodokan where they described his judo style as “bane-bane” (loosely translated, “very springy”).
