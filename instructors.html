		<h1>Ervin Brandon</h1>
			<p>Coach Ervin began learning Judo at Howard University under Lewis Cuffy and his instructor Dr. Dong Ja Yang. While competing in Judo, he also became a member of the Howard Wrestling Team where he met fellow instructor Isaac July. Upon graduating, Ervin spent 3 years in Japan training Judo and teaching it to both elementary and junior high kids in the village of Murone-mura. He received his Black Belt from the Kodokan where they described his judo style as “bane-bane” (loosely translated, “very springy”). Before he left Japan he became the first foreigner to win the local Ichinoseki Judo Cup in his prefecture of Iwate-ken. Ervin is also a BJJ brown belt under Lloyd Irvin. </p>
